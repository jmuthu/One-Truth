http:

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for service requests.
  port: 9000

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for administrative requests.
  adminPort: 9001

  # Maximum number of threads.
  maxThreads: 100

  # Minimum number of thread to keep alive.
  minThreads: 10

  # The type of connector to use. Other valid values are "nonblocking" or "legacy". In general, the
  # blocking connector should be used for low-latency services with short request durations. The
  # nonblocking connector should be used for services with long request durations or which
  # specifically take advantage of Jetty's continuation support.
  # If you need SSL support, you can either choose from "nonblocking+ssl" or "legacy+ssl".
  connectorType: nonblocking

  # The maximum amount of time a connection is allowed to be idle before being closed.
  maxIdleTime: 1s

  # The number of threads dedicated to accepting connections. If omitted, this defaults to the
  # number of logical CPUs on the current machine.
  acceptorThreads: 3

  # The offset of the acceptor threads' priorities. Can be [-5...5], with -5 dropping the acceptor
  # threads to the lowest possible priority and with 5 raising them to the highest priority.
  acceptorThreadPriorityOffset: 0

  # The number of unaccepted requests to keep in the accept queue before refusing connections. If
  # set to -1 or omitted, the system default is used.

  # The maximum number of buffers to keep in memory.

  # Enables SO_LINGER on the server socket with the specified linger time.
  soLingerTime: 1s

  # The number of open connections at which the server transitions to a "low-resources" mode.
  lowResourcesConnectionThreshold: 25000

  # When in low-resources mode, the maximum amount of time a connection is allowed to be idle before
  # being closed. Overrides maxIdleTime.

  useForwardedHeaders: true

  # If true, forces the HTTP connector to use off-heap, direct buffers.
  useDirectBuffers: true

  # The hostname of the interface to which the HTTP server socket wil be found. If omitted, the
  # socket will listen on all interfaces.
  # bindHost: app1.example.com

    # optional, JKS is default. JCEKS is another likely candidate.

logging:

  # The default level of all loggers. Can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, or ALL.

    # When the log file rotates, the archived log will be renamed to this and gzipped. The
